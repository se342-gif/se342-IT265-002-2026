#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ ] Establish game content/overview
- [ ] Decide on physical appeal/design and or theme/color palette
- [ ] - Settle on basic rules for card game after having seen examples (although prone to changing)
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Since the theme is on  dessert-themed items, mainly physical appeal, I found that it’d be easy to have food as slots with ingredients or layering as part of the points-system. Each character has a deck of cards to choose from and they take turns either sabatoging or improving their food design. It’s a cute and fun way to mix the main physical appeal with the original short, mini-game concepts. The “boards” here are the base foods

- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Narrowing down on concepts, making it more coherent for gameplay, in other words, justifiable and or understandable. Should I incorporate a score-based game that’s simple and straightforward or focus more on the lore and make it more narrative-based. 
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Learned about the many ways to translate the game design pitch into boards games with common rules, unique storytellings, and set rules through cards and or board games. Learned more about color in video games and basics into color palette and the color wheel used for picking color schemes in games that make it so visually engaging and sometimes indistinguishable.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Cake stacking game translated through deck of cards, food base with ingredients to fill in slots, collecting certain cards as points. 

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Narrow down on specific rules and board game idea, decide on board concepts, perhaps a spiral shape, round ring shape (classic round, cylinder-shaped came) etc.
