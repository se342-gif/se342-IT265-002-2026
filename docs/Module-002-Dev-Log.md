#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Learning game balance and symmetry, how to integrate in into future game concepts
- [ ] Understanding the different types of game balance, advantages/disadvantages and effect on player experience
- [ ] Narrowing down mini game concept to a pixel game and experimenting with world building ideas

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - player and understood symmetry in games. Symmetry is rather fair but can ultimately be boring/low stakes with equal advantages. While broken symmetry has its various options and ultimately depends more on the players’ skills and experience. Also got the opportunity to narrow down the design of the mini-games to something more suitable for my studio; I plan to maintain the mini game concept in a pixel-style world. I hope to learn more about game mechanics and how to incorporate them in future game architectures/designs.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Understanding game balance and symmetry at base level, differentiating between the different types in both and applying it to the mini game concept. Attempt at maintaining game symmetry or rather mix of both in future game production/designs.

- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - Avoid overcomplicating concepts: symmetries and balances. Maintain simple mechanics that work over complexity/layered mechanics. 

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Differentiating between various symmetries in games and their given advantages and disadvantages with each, applying it to future concepts. 
- Basic introduction into reward system in games. 
- While not all gameplay choices are meaningful, they should ultimately still serve some purpose regardless of the disadvantages in power balance.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  breaking down symmetries among various games - experiment, see what works best and what doesn’t and how to go about executing in design production. See how it can be integrated in mini games concept (as a whole or in seperate games - or rather partially involved in some parts)


- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
