## Name: Salma Elsherif 
### Module:  Module 1 - Game Concepts

<!-- Repeat the below as needed-->
### Date: [01/26/2026]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Familiarize myself with course materials and expectations
- [ ] Research and brainstorm ideas for mini game concept
- [ ] Research and brainstorm visual narrative/theme/aesthetic for game concept
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
    - Brainstormed general ideas for the concept of the mini game. Inspired by cozy-games and mini cooking games/puzzles like Cooking Mama for example.
  - Focused on visual appeal games like cooking mama or ddlc (cute, endearing, style; visual novel)
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
    -  New to gaming with minimal expeprience outside of IT201, familiar with unity and unreal engine as well as basic game mechanics but not clear on how to translate it to the mini-game/puzzle concept. Want to research more narrative-based(mixed) games and their visual appeal.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
    - Focused on much smaller, more manageable games rather than large, full-scale/completed games; focused on visuals

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-   N/A - still in the research and overall brainstorming phase

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
  - How to go about the narrative-based portion and actual mini games (ie. introducing story -> introduction to game)
  - If I could increase difficulty in games as player progresses throughout stages/levels with more obstacles or rather add more features (increase complexity for example)
  - How to go about designing the world - large free space for players to explore with characters or assets to interact with, small-scale world with puzzles, or transition between puzzles through character interactions. 
  - Could collecting the ingredient assets for example, unlock new mini-games or rather other assets/features for the player - in-game currency or achievements?
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  layout of the mini-games/puzzles, character interactions, assets to be placed and interacted with
